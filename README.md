# Train-Crash-Prediction-System
Train Crash Prediction System
#Developed a machine learning-based train crash prediction project following a significant train accident in Odisha, which aimed to contribute to proactive safety measures in the railway industry.
Conducted data preprocessing, and feature identification, and engineered new variables to enhance model performance.

While this project remains under development, I'm committed to continuous exploration and refinement. My current progress can be further explored through the following resources:
